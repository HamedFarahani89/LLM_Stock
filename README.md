# **StockLLM: Retrieval-Augmented Q&A for Stock Market Insights**

This repository showcases a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that leverages **LangChain** and **Streamlit** to analyze and answer questions about stock market concepts using Large Language Models (LLMs). Users can input stock market-related article URLs, process them into embeddings, and query insights interactively.

---

## **Key Features**  
1. **Web-Based Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive, user-friendly experience.  
2. **Document Processing**: Load unstructured stock market data from URLs using **LangChain's UnstructuredURLLoader**.  
3. **Text Splitting**: Efficiently splits documents into manageable chunks with **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.  
4. **Embeddings & Storage**:  
   - Generate embeddings using **OpenAIEmbeddings**.  
   - Store embeddings in a FAISS vector store for fast retrieval.  
5. **Q&A with Sources**: Answer user queries with **RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain**, ensuring accurate responses and providing source references.  
6. **Persistent Storage**: Save and load vector embeddings using **Pickle** for reusability.

## **Dependencies**  

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:  

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain openai faiss-cpu python-dotenv unstructured
```

---

## **How It Works**  

1. **Environment Setup**:  
   - Save your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file for secure access.  

   Example `.env` file:  
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Process Workflow**:  

   - **Step 1**: Enter up to 3 URLs of stock market-related articles in the sidebar.  
   - **Step 2**: Click "Process URLs" to load and split the documents into chunks.  
   - **Step 3**: Generate embeddings using **OpenAIEmbeddings** and store them in a FAISS vector database.  
   - **Step 4**: Query the processed content using a question-based input, and retrieve relevant answers along with sources.  

3. **Core Components**:  
   - `os`: Interact with the operating system (e.g., checking file paths).  
   - `streamlit`: Build the web-based user interface.  
   - `pickle`: Save and load the FAISS vector database.  
   - `time`: Simulate delays for a smoother user experience.  
   - **LangChain Modules**:  
     - `UnstructuredURLLoader`: Loads data from the provided URLs.  
     - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`: Splits long text into smaller, manageable chunks for processing.  
     - `OpenAIEmbeddings`: Converts text into numerical embeddings for storage and retrieval.  
     - `FAISS`: Stores embeddings in a fast, searchable index.  
     - `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain`: Retrieves relevant information and generates answers with sources.

## **Usage**  

1. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Follow these steps:  
   - Input URLs in the sidebar.  
   - Click "Process URLs" to extract and store information.  
   - Ask a question in the main input box.  
   - View the AI-generated answer and corresponding sources.  

---

## **Example Workflow**  

1. **Input URLs**:  
   - Example: News articles or stock reports from financial sites.  

2. **Ask a Question**:  
   ```plaintext
   "What are the key trends in the stock market this week?"
   ```

3. **Output**:  
   - AI-generated answer with reference sources.

## **Applications**  

- **Stock Market Analysis**: Analyze news articles, reports, and trends.  
- **Educational Tool**: Practice stock market concepts interactively.  
- **Content Exploration**: Summarize and extract key insights from large financial documents.

---

## **Future Improvements**  

- Add support for real-time stock market data.  
- Enhance retrieval speed with advanced FAISS configurations.  
- Integrate additional LLMs for broader model choices.
